# UI/UX — Cool & Simple for Rimbaud

## Direction
- Minimal, confident, practical. No gradients; rely on clean type, spacing, and subtle elevation.
- Motion is functional: focus/hover states and small progress indicators; no decorative effects.

## Visual System
- Colors: Neutral 900/800/200/50 with a single accent (Azure #2563eb).
- Typography: Inter (UI), JetBrains Mono (tech labels). Sizes 12–18 for body, 24–32 for headings.
- Shapes: 10–14px radii, 1px hairline borders, soft 12–24px shadows only on key surfaces.

## Screens
- Home: Create/Join Session (server creates `id`). Language pickers per role, connection status.
- Call: Push‑to‑talk, live inbound/outbound transcripts, barge‑in indicator, latency chip.
- Voice: Paste ElevenLabs voiceId, validate, preview; or upload sample to create voice.
- History (later): Simple list of past sessions and transcripts.

## Components
- Primary button: solid accent, rounded, clear affordance.
- Secondary: neutral outline, subtle hover.
- Inputs: neutral background, clear focus ring, inline validation.
- Toasts: concise top‑right, auto‑dismiss.

## Accessibility
- WCAG AA contrast on all text; keyboard‑navigable controls; reduced motion preference respected.
